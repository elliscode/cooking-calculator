        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Simply write in the amount of your ingredient, and what you would like to convert to, and the calculator will
          take care of the conversion!</p>
        <p>You can even convert from volume units, such as cups, to mass units, such as grams, if you provide an
          ingredient name with a known density.</p>

        <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
        <p>As an avid home baker, I am always looking up new recipes, and I have found that they are not always in the
          friendliest ingredient format. For instance, I have no way of measuring mL in my kitchen, and I am often
          opening up several searches on how to convert from one unit to another. In the hustle and bustle of baking, I
          don't always get my math correct, which has led to several ruined meals and desserts.</p>
        <p>Now with the Ingredient Converter, I can simply type in what the recipe states for a given ingredient, and
          what I would like to measure with, whether that be a mass unit such as grams, or a volume unit such as cups.
          As long as the ingredient you are using is in our ingredient database with a density, the tool will be able to
          convert between mass and volume units without issue.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why does my result say ???</h2>
        <p>This means you were trying to convert between mass and volume units for a food with an unknown density. This tool has a list of ingredient densities that it uses to convert between mass and volume units, and if a density is not known, it defaults to an unknown result of ???.</p>
